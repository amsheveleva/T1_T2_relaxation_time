# T1_T2_relaxation_time
fitting and plotting of T1 and Tm relaxation measured in EPR spectroscopy 
Relaxation times are important paraments physics. 
First, we derive the tables of data using MATLAB script and saved in Excel tables of relaxation times measured in EPR spectroscopy
experiment by inversion recovery and spin echo experiment and derived, respectively. 
And then, we process the data using Python libraries to plot and analyse the data.
